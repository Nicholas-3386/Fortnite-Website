    Vindertech’s Mistake
So, the story of Fortnite begins as such:

In the beginning, there was just the storm…and Vindertech

An odd and mysterious storm of unknown origins has plagued the earth, taking quite a bit of the population with it. (We know this via Save The World mode)

It has been theorized that the storm was actually a product of a technology company called “Vindertech”. But why would Vindertech, a company that makes technology to fight the storm, create an apocalyptic storm? Simple, make a problem, sell a solution. It’s to be believed that Vindertech created the storm to sell their products. These “Pre-storm products” are unknown and never really talked about.

But what Vindertech hadn’t planned on was the impact of the storm, and what they had just created. This storm would just be a nuisance, it would be catastrophic. It would *almost, end the world.

But once the storms hit, and the damage was done. Vindertech “Disappeared”…or so we thought…

The Solution
It’s also revealed in STW that Vindertech “Went Dark” after the storms, yet their technology was seen everywhere. Chances are, if it’s tech, it’s Vindertech. So this leads me to believe that Vindertech didn’t actually go away, they just went to change themselves.

(Stay with me here, The Battle Royale lore is coming!)

Vindertech “retreated” to repurpose their tech to help any survivors fight the storm. The storms main affect on people is it’s essentially Poisonous to humans. As seen in STW, the storm mutates humans into zombie-like creatures known as Husks. People had no way to fight these storms until Vindertech brought their weapons to the public. (This may also explain why the storm got so far out of hand, is because Vindertech had to retreat to make these weapons.)

So, for those who haven’t played it, STW starts out with a cutscene if a survivor taking shelter in what appears to be an old Vindertech facility. This facility I believe was abandoned once Vindertech went into hiding to make their new tech. Now this facility is home to a robot named “Ray” who wants to, you guessed it, save the world. But she’s just a tiny robot so she enlists the help of people known as “Heroes” (the people you play as) to help her with the dirty work. There was a limited time mission where you had to find a survivor out in a mission, and after you rescue her, states she wants to join you. Ray however then goes on to say that these “Heroes” are trained at what they do. So here is where I believe Battle Royale comes in. Battle Royale is a distant island somewhere on the planet that these heroes are sent to so they can find the best of the best. But how what one find the best out of, say, 100 people? Simple, have them to fight to the (near) death!

Battle Royale
So these heroes are chosen to fight the storm and go out into the world by having them train in battle Royale. This is alluded to when your character gets “eliminated” (or deemed “unfit”) while fighting. Notice that your character never just lays there and dies, they always get teleported away. This also proves why the word “kill” is never in the game. Because you never actually die, just injured and returned to home base (The lobby screen) to ready up and prove your worth over and over again until you indeed are “The best out of 100”

You might be thinking “Cool, you’ve wasted hours researching and typing to tell us that a company made a storm, then trains people to fight it…Bravo…”

But now here’s the interesting bit. Why in a matter of a year and half has this island been but through dimensions, practically turned into a climate change specialists nightmare, been visited by a giant dimensional Rubix cube, and and now been smashed into by another island on an iceberg? Well, that’s where we talk about our old pal, the storm again.

The Storm’s Power
I’ve already stated that Vindertech was in WAY over their head while trying to create to storm. They had no idea what they were creating, they just thought whatever it was, they could make a solution to fight it and they’d be rich and it would go away. Well whatever they put in this storm literally has the power to create Monsters that nobody can even imagine. For example, Crackshot? It’s recently been revealed that he is not a man in a costume. He is an actual product of the storm. An actual monster that is hellbent on making sure everybody has Christmas cheer…or else. So as you can see, this storm can create unthinkable things and because of that, can make unthinkable things happen.

First Contact
Our first “phenomenon” however wasn’t actually caused by the storm. It was just your average everyday alien just coming to give us a friendly visit. His intentions are unknown, but “The Visitor” came from space in case you didn’t pick that up. While he crash landed, people were starting to get ahold of themselves after the events of the storms, and apparently even started making movies! (This is seen as the Carbide and Omega movie being produced all through season 4). As the government was trying to contain The Visitor, players could see something out of the natural for the first time…Hop Rocks.

It’s possible that The Visitir was actually running from something. (Quite possibly some kind of space police, is my guess) He most likely stole or brought whatever Hop Rocks were, and that’s why they appeared when he did. (This is also hinted as to why they were only in meteor crash sites). But once the visitor broke free from his pod, he was faced with a problem…how does he get home?

The Rift
Picture it, your sitting with your film crew after a hard days work, when all of the sudden that FAKE rocket you built decides to take itself on a joy ride. This is obviously the visitors doing as seen in a certain loading screen. The visitor used the “hop rock tech” to fuel and turn this fake rocket into a fully functional rocket. But unfortunately for the inhabitants of earth, gasoline pollution ain’t got nothing on hop rock pollution (especially when mixed with the effects of the storm). Once the rocket blasted off it was using so much energy that it couldn’t be contained but instead of exploding, it rather…imploded.

Apparently the hop rocks have some kind of inter dimensional ties (this may also be why the visitor was perhaps trying to steal them) because once the ship imploded it caused a huge tear in the sky that we would soon find out to hit a lot closer to home than anybody could have thought…literally.

Our World
This tear wasn’t just your average sky crack. It would be the start of 2 seasons worth of lore and story that would quite possibly change the course of Fortnite as we know it. This “Rift” was proven to be a link between our world, and Fortnite world. Right around the turn of season 4 going into 5, something showed up in OUR desert. Something very juicey and cheesy. That’s right, The durr burger statue from grease grove showed up in our world. There were many clues left at the durr burger site that unfortunately weren’t decided in time before it was revealed to us via the game, but there was secret codes hidden around that showed us exact locations of where a certain cube would appear within the coming days.

His Name Is Kevin
Once our little cube friend (Obviously charged with some kind of energy) decided to make landfall (which by the way, took the rift in the sky with him) it began to roll around the map, making “runes” he then decided to melt into loot lake and start us of on season 6 with a high note! (Again…Literally)

So as seen in the season 6 trailer, the cube (known as Kevin by most) started to pick up the house in loot lake and lift it about 300 ft in the air and also felt the need to make a tornado in the process. (Oh Kevin, you little scamp!) this cube then goes to each “rune” and “activates” them, causing each rune to start to hover and glow.

It’s thought that these runes were put there to make a sort of track for Kevin follow while making his second joyride around the map. Once Kevin had achieved his goal and sucked the energy back from the runes that all met just southwest of dusty divot, he moved back to Leaky lake for his grand finale. He went out with a boom (you already know the drill……..Literally)

The Butterfly Effect
If players saw this happen, they would have been transported into an unknown dimension that was all white and surrounded by all 99 other players floating around them. But out of nowhere, a rift appears and then slowly forms into a butterfly. The butterfly would land on the player and then send them back to earth and welcome them to a beautiful new island now what a new improved loot lake.

The Reasons
So now pops the question, who the heck is Kevin, and what the heck was seasons 5-6 all about? So here’s the low down. Season 5 is about the chaos created in season 4 by the visitor’s rift rocket implosion. Two worlds colliding, players literally having the ability to use dimensional gate ways for their own leisure, and apparently judging by the Viking ship, time was also involved in this catastrophe. But the silver lining was the “road trip” skin found in week 7 of season 5. It was called the “The Enforcer” with the tag line “Balance and order must be restored”. The enforcers jobs were to bring the cube to earth to rebalance or “cleanse” the earth of its unstable state. However it’s obvious that these enforcers weren’t from Fortnite s dimension OR our dimension, so this proves there was a 3rd party dimension the whole time (I believe players physical state was in this dimension while using the shadow stones). So they were sent to clean up the visitors disaster during seasons 4-6. And once Kevin restored balance to earth (the butterfly is meant to be a physical embodiment of balance during the explosion event). Players could rest at ease knowing everything was restored…

A Cold Awakening
But then they started to feel a bit chilly all of the sudden… thins were pretty calm the last few weeks of season 6 with the only thing happening being a dinky little snow cloud on the horizon and the appearance of every bodies special little robot friend A.I.M. Who’s origins were unknown, but his hands and feet were frozen solid. He came from the south, almost the exact direction of the cloud, but surely it was a coincidence right…right?

Power Hungry
So once season 7 started we are greeted with a giant iceberg smashing into the islands southwest shores and once again, giving us a massive terrain change from tilted to what WAS flush factory. The most noticeable thing about our new frozen neighbors is that right off the bat we notice a research group has put up equipment and vehicles ALL over the island. This is also the same group that sent AIM to warn us about the oncoming storm (or spy on us, I’m not sure yet). However the biggest change of all the iceberg itself, polar peak. It houses a castle with a mysterious and possibly threatening king known as the ice king. At first we could only visit the top part of the castle since it hadn’t melted yet, but we soon notice that the ice is melting, revealing more castle each day. However, this wasn’t something necessarily good, as things got stranger the more it melted. Our first red flag was that the ice king has a chunk of the the meteorite. Our second red flag was just your average dragon egg chilling in the castles dungeons. Now it was proposed by a redditor (I can’t say who because it’s been passed along so many times, I just know it’s not me) that it wasn’t a coincidence that the iceberg crashed on OUR island. They said that the ice king was coming for something, something he needed, that we had.

…Kevin…

It was theorized that the ice king needs A LOT of energy to hatch those dragon eggs and we think that’s why he has a piece of the meteor, is because it’s still flowing with energy from the hop rocks. But it wasn’t enough, so now he needs more energy, and what has a crap ton of energy on our island? You guessed it! Pieces of Kevin.

But unfortunately this is where our story must come to an end, because we’ve reached the present day. So until more happens, this is it!
