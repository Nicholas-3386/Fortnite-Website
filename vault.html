    <h1> FORTNITE VAULT - REMOVED ITEMS LIST </h1>
  Here's a list of the currently vaulted items in Fortnite: Battle Royale. Keep in mind that these items can be brought back into the game at some point, so while they are gone at the moment, don't be surprised to see one or two of these back someday.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h2>CEILING TRAP, SPIKE TRAP, & WALL DYNAMO</h2>
    Once upon time in Fortnite, there was multiple versions of traps. These included the Ceiling Trap, which obviously would attach to the ceiling. It also included the Wall Dynamo, which would obviously attach to the wall. Finally, there was the Spike Trap which would be attached to the floor. These traps were essentially all combined into the trap we have today which is the Damage Trap.

    These are very unlikely to return, the combination of these traps made the design a lot simpler. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see traps that do something other than damage you.

  <h2>SUBMACHINE GUN</h2>
At one point, there was three different submachine guns in the game. The standard SMG, tactical SMG, and the suppressed SMG. The original SMG was not a whole lot different than the tactical version. The standard SMG had a slightly larger clip and did slightly less damage than the tactical version. This was honestly just a smart move by Epic to reduce confusion and simplify/tighten up the game. If people can barely tell the difference between two items then it's usually best to get rid of one.

<h2>SMOKE GRENADE</h2>


This addition to the vault was a bit of a surprise and happened in patch 3.3 on March 15th, 2018. The smoke grenade is a pretty unique item in the game, and while not always useful, had usefulness as a way to escape or confuse an enemy. It wasn't long for the game, so I imagine we'll see it again at some point, or at the very least re-imagined as a slightly different item.
</p>
<p>
<h2>GUIDED MISSILE</h2>


In the 3.5 content update the controversial guided missile will be added to the vault. The item was met with pretty harsh reviews when it was added to the game. It kind of forced people to turtle up heavily, and really restricted the speed of the game once it was known that a player had one. While you could shoot it down, it was often much easier just to turtle up against it. The biggest issue with this weapon was that it was super powerful in squads. The person launching the missiles could be protected by their team, which made it extra difficult do anything about it once they start flying.



The guided missiles originally had their movement speed and turn radius reduced, but due to a bug the weapon was taken out of the game temporarily. This temporary solution is ending up to be a permanent one for now, and it remains to be seen if we will see this weapon again in the future!
</p>
<p>
<h2>CROSSBOW</h2>


The crossbow has been vaulted in the 4.0 patch for Fortnite. This patch brought along Season 4 which came with a lot of big changes to the map. The crossbow was a pretty fringe weapon, only really used as a last ditch option or if you had no other gun available. The hunting rifle is a much better gun, even without a scope due to the headshots being able to kill at any hp + projectiles arriving at their target faster.
</p>
<p>
<h2>JETPACK</h2>


The Jet Pack was moved to the vault in the v4.4 patch. While it was an interesting item and made for some dynamic plays, it was also made out-building your opponent less important which felt kind of bad. We'll see if the jetpack makes a return in the future, but for now it will hold a place in the vault.
</p>
<p>
<h2>TACTICAL SMG</h2>


One of the new favorites to use for shredding walls and replacing one of their shotguns. This has now been moved to the vault in favor of the new Submachine Gun. The Suppressed SMG is still in the game, so there are still two main choices in this slot that use light ammunition. The new Submachine Gun comes in three rarities, but only common, uncommon, and rare. This means there is no longer an epic version of the SMG. This might leave room for an epic and legendary version to come out down the line.

<h2>INFINITY GAUNTLET</h2>


The Infinity Gauntlet is a special Mythic item in the Battle Royale LTM Infinity Gauntlet. Whoever picks up the Gauntlet transforms into Thanos and acquires his abilities. Here is your list of abilities:

Ability 1 — A mighty punch that knocks enemies back and destroys structures.
Ability 2 — Thanos flies towards the ground, hitting an area for knockback and damage.
Ability 3 — Harness the energy of the Power stone to fire a blast that deals damage over time.
Ability 4 — A super-jump that can vault Thanos over all but the largest obstructions.
Thanos has both shields and health. When he eliminates another player, his shields regenerate. His health never regenerates.
Thanos doesn’t take fall damage.
Thanos does not build, use weapons or things like launch pads. He has no need for such petty human devices. There is only one Infinity Gauntlet in each match. The Infinity Gauntlet will drop as loot if the wielder dies.

<h2>INFINITY BLADE</h2>
Infinity Blade was a Melee Weapon in Battle Royale available in Mythic variant. It delivered a powerful sword slash and dealt 75 damage to enemies and destroys structures in one hit. It also allowed the player to leap great distances, destroying objects in its path. Upon landing, it delivers damage and a knock-up to nearby players with 25 damage. The wielder of the sword was also granted the following additional abilities:

An increased pool of max Health and Shields (200 Health/200 Shields);
Regeneration of effective Health over time up to max Health and Shields (1 HP per second).
An instant burst of effective Health upon elimination of an enemy (50 HP).
Increased movement speed (130%).
The first player to pull the Infinity Blade from its pedestal will be instantly healed to full Health and Shields. If a player picks up the Infinity Blade, all other inventory items aside from building materials will be dropped. When the wielder of the Infinity Blade picks up an item (aside from building materials), the Infinity Blade will be dropped. The Infinity Blade will be dropped when the wielder is knocked out or eliminated. It was found at Polar Peak and only one Infinity Blade is available per match.

On the killfeed, It will come up as (Player name)’s Infinity Blade erased (Victim’s name)

It was vaulted on December 14, 2018.
